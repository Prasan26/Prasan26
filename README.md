- I am interested in Cybersecurity, and coding has kept me excited since I was in 6th grade. I consider myself good at Linux, but I do functional C++ and python. I am a CE|H, and an MTA holder. Two of my research papers related to IoT and Cyberextortion have been published in two Australian magazines. I am also a Research club manager at eC Council University. Along with that, I also have my community focused on Cybersecurity.
- I love Hackathons
- Previously I have mentored at:  Hack The Mountains, Hack this fall, shell hacks, hackodisha, Octafest, FIU Annual hackathon, Div Hacks, GeorgeTown, HackSC. There I mentored the participants in the field of Cybersecurity and programming. 
- I have judged at hackathons: hackodisha, SunHacks, Deltahack8. 
- I also have been a panelist and speaker at Div Hacks (Columbia University) and Octafest'21.
