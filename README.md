- Ever since I was a little kid, computers and tech have been my passion. I still remember how I saw my mentor made me type code lines in C++ because of his laziness( haha), but for me, it was like magic when he compiled and ran the code. It was a calculator, and for the whole day, I was astonished that my fingers typed those funny little symbols and resulted in a calculator of our own. I always think what my first cade was, a hello world program or that calculator whose code I typed. Throughout middle school, I clung to whatever project ideas I could get, moving from “hello world” all the way to a simple handwriting analyzer tool, with dozens of projects in between. I learned C++, then visual basics coming all the way to advanced Linux.
This passion makes me felt alive, above all the other subjects, because everything I've studied, every language I've learned, has nothing to do with my schooling because there were a couple of opportunities for the field of computer science. In this gap year ( 2021 ), I have learned more than I aimed and ever could have imagined as a kid. I learned and practiced Cybersecurity, Linux ( Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu, Mint, garuda, Fedora ), new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, networking, all with more enthusiasm than I had as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there is yet to learn.
These skills have helped me expand this knowledge to other local students as all the hard work inspired others to give programming a hit; I teach and guide other students whenever I can, despite being not a university student (currently).
It was this year I learned and achieved. I earned my first legit, licensed certification of Certified Ethical Hacker( CE|H v11 ), became part of The Genius World record for making AI program using python, earned my first appreciation letter for my programming skills, and achieved Microsoft Technology Associate ( MTA ) Certification for python.
So, now, in industry, this passion remains the same and gets exciting every day. There is certainly more to learn, more problems to solve, and yet more to build, to make this world a better place. And for this, I am very grateful that I took 2021 as my Gap Year.
